Backup node: 192.168.1.211
VIP Address: 192.168.1.215, 192.168.1.216

Step 1) Connect to server via ssh or console

Step 2) Install some package requirement

export CFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include/openssl/'

./configure --enable-snmp
make

vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
    script "/usr/sbin/pidof haproxy"  ###Important for haproxy check status
    interval 2
    weight 2

vrrp_instance kss-keepalived {
    state MASTER
    interface ens33
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 101 ###Value Important
    advert_int 1
	mcast_src_ip 192.168.1.210
    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass kss
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.215 dev ens33
        192.168.1.216 dev ens33
    }
	track_script {

vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
    script "/usr/sbin/pidof haproxy"  ###Important for haproxy check status
    interval 2

vrrp_instance kss-keepalived {
    state BACKUP
    interface ens33
    virtual_router_id 51
    priority 100 ###Value Important
    advert_int 1
	mcast_src_ip 192.168.1.211
    authentication {

        auth_pass kss
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        192.168.1.215 dev ens33
        192.168.1.216 dev ens33
    }
	track_script {
        chk_haproxy
    }
