You can use Vim programmatically with the option -c {command}:

DOS to Unix:

vim file.txt -c "set ff=unix" -c ":wq"
Unix to DOS:

vim file.txt -c "set ff=dos" -c ":wq"
"set ff=unix/dos" means change fileformat (ff) of the file to Unix/DOS end of line format.

":wq" means write the file to disk and quit the editor (allowing to use the command in a loop).
