1) Change hostname to FQND
hostnamectl set-hostname ldap1.citigo.dc

2) Add hosts information
vim /etc/hosts
192.168.17.25	ldap1.citigo.dc

3) Install FreeIPA-Server and FreeIPA-DNS
yum install freeipa-server freeipa-server-dns

ipa-server-install --setup-dns

The log file for this installation can be found in /var/log/ipaserver-install.log
==============================================================================
This program will set up the IPA Server.

This includes:
  * Configure a stand-alone CA (dogtag) for certificate management
  * Configure the Network Time Daemon (ntpd)
  * Create and configure an instance of Directory Server
  * Create and configure a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
  * Configure Apache (httpd)
  * Configure DNS (bind)
  * Configure the KDC to enable PKINIT

To accept the default shown in brackets, press the Enter key.

WARNING: conflicting time&date synchronization service 'chronyd' will be disabled
in favor of ntpd

Enter the fully qualified domain name of the computer
on which you're setting up server software. Using the form
<hostname>.<domainname>
Example: master.example.com.

# confirm the hostname and Enter
Server host name [ldap1.citigo.dc]:

Warning: skipping DNS resolution of host dlp.citigo.dc
The domain name has been determined based on the host name.

# confirm the domain name and Enter
Please confirm the domain name [citigo.dc]:

The kerberos protocol requires a Realm name to be defined.
This is typically the domain name converted to uppercase.

# confirm the realm name and Enter
Please provide a realm name [CITIGO.DC]:
Certain directory server operations require an administrative user.
This user is referred to as the Directory Manager and has full access
to the Directory for system management tasks and will be added to the
instance of directory server created for IPA.
The password must be at least 8 characters long.

# set Directory Manager's password
Directory Manager password:
Password (confirm):

The IPA server requires an administrative user, named 'admin'.
This user is a regular system account used for IPA server administration.

# set IPA admin's password
IPA admin password:
Password (confirm):

Checking DNS domain citigo.dc., please wait ...
# if you set DNS fowarder, answer [yes]
Do you want to configure DNS forwarders? [yes]:
Following DNS servers are configured in /etc/resolv.conf: 8.8.8.8
# if you search reverse zone, answer [yes]
Do you want to configure these servers as DNS forwarders? [yes]:
All DNS servers from /etc/resolv.conf were added. You can enter additional addresses now:
Enter an IP address for a DNS forwarder, or press Enter to skip:
Checking DNS forwarders, please wait ...
DNS server 8.8.8.8: answer to query '. SOA' is missing DNSSEC signatures (no RRSIG data)
Please fix forwarder configuration to enable DNSSEC support.
(For BIND 9 add directive "dnssec-enable yes;" to "options {}")
WARNING: DNSSEC validation will be disabled
Do you want to search for missing reverse zones? [yes]:

The IPA Master Server will be configured with:
Hostname:       ldap1.citigo.dc
IP address(es): 192.168.17.25
Domain name:    citigo.dc
Realm name:     CITIGO.DC

BIND DNS server will be configured to serve IPA domain with:
Forwarders:       8.8.8.8
Forward policy:   only
Reverse zone(s):  No reverse zone

# confirm settings and proceed with [yes]
Continue to configure the system with these values? [no]: yes

The following operations may take some minutes to complete.
Please wait until the prompt is returned.

==============================================================================
Setup complete

Next steps:
        1. You must make sure these network ports are open:
                TCP Ports:
                  * 80, 443: HTTP/HTTPS
                  * 389, 636: LDAP/LDAPS
                  * 88, 464: kerberos
                  * 53: bind
                UDP Ports:
                  * 88, 464: kerberos
                  * 53: bind
                  * 123: ntp

        2. You can now obtain a kerberos ticket using the command: 'kinit admin'
           This ticket will allow you to use the IPA tools (e.g., ipa user-add)
           and the web user interface.

Be sure to back up the CA certificates stored in /root/cacert.p12
These files are required to create replicas. The password for these
files is the Directory Manager password

4) Open firewalld
[root@ldap1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-service={freeipa-ldap,freeipa-ldaps,dns,ntp} --permanent
[root@ldap1 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
